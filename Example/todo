Remaining:
- Replace Unbox.framework (that is built for device) with carthage when an official release is available
- Wait for ReactiveSwift OFFICIAL (not alpha) 1.0 is released. Hopefully it will contain substitutes for the (now purged) legacy "rac_***" functions (https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/issues/37)
- Fix all FIXMES


- Reactify stuff, e.g. LoginViewController, etc.
- MVVMify stuff, e.g. LoginViewController, UserListViewController
- Fix all FIXMEs
