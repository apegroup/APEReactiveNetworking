Remaining:
- Wait for ReactiveSwift OFFICIAL (not alpha) 1.0 is released. Hopefully it will contain substitutes for the (now purged) legacy "rac_***" functions (https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift/issues/37)
- Fix all FIXMEs


0) Connect scenes
1) Error handling
2) Improve MVVM + reactive
2) Upload avatar url (PUT)
3) Delete avatar (DELETE)
